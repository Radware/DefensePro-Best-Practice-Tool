# DefensePro-Best-Practice-Tool


DefensePro Best-Practice Configurator is a tool which configures one or more DefensePro’s with best practice configuration using REST-API’s.
The application uses a configuration file (Excel format), which will be filled by the customer and the field engineer with very basic information for example: application type, policy BW, CDN methods etc.
This config file will be used by the application for deploying the best-practice configuration on the DefensePros automatically.
By the end of this process, the DefensePro’s will have all the required security policies for the initial setup and ready for further tunning. 
The current version (v7) is suitable for enterprise deployments only.
